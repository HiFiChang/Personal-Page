## Why Start a Blog?

Writing is thinking. I've always found that the act of putting thoughts into words forces a clarity that pure thinking cannot. This blog is my space to share what I learn, what I build, and what I think about along the way.

## A Little About Me

I'm a junior Computer Science student at **Renmin University of China**. My days are spent somewhere between reading papers, writing code, and occasionally staring at terminal outputs wondering what went wrong.

My interests span a few areas:

- **Artificial Intelligence** — especially large language models and their applications
- **Systems Programming** — compilers, operating systems, and the beauty of low-level code
- **Creative Technology** — building things that are both useful and aesthetically pleasing

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

1. Technical deep-dives into projects I'm working on
2. Paper readings and reflections
3. Thoughts on design, tools, and workflow
4. Occasional life updates

## A Code Example

Here's a simple Python snippet, because every first blog post needs one:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """A warm greeting."""
    return f"Hello, {name}. Welcome to the blog."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(greet("World"))
```

## Looking Forward

Here's to building something, one post at a time.
